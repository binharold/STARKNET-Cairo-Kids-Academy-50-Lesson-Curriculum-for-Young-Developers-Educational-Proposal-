🎯 PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This is a comprehensive 50-lesson curriculum designed to teach Cairo to young developers. Each lesson is carefully structured to build fundamental programming concepts while maintaining engagement through gamification and interactive learning.

🎓 CURRICULUM STRUCTURE:
Lesson 1: First Steps in Cairo

#[contract]
mod MyFirstProgram {
    #[storage]
    struct Storage {
        message: felt252  
    }

    #[constructor]
    fn constructor(ref self: ContractState) {
        self.message.write('Hello! I am learning Cairo!');
    }

    #[view]
    fn show_message(self: @ContractState) -> felt252 {
        self.message.read()
    }
}
